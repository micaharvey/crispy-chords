Lean On Me - Bill Withers


Verse
C                F
Sometimes in our lives
            C
we all have pain
            Em   G
We all have sorrow
C                F
But if we are wise
             C              G      C  
We know that there's always tomorrow

Chorus
C                           F    
Lean on me, when you're not strong
                 C
And I'll be your friend
              Em    G 
I'll help you carry on
C               F
For it won't be long
               C
'Til I'm gonna need
            G    C
Somebody to lean on

Verse
C                   F
Please swallow your pride
          C
If I have things
            Em   G           
you need to borrow
C              F                         
For no one can fill
              C
those of your needs
               G   C   
That you don't let show


Chorus


Verse
C             F
If there is a load
            C
you have to bear
               Em  G
That you can't carry
C                F
I'm right up the road
                C
I'll share your load
            G    C
If you just call me


C                                    G      C
So just call on me brother, when you need a hand
C                       G    C
We all need somebody to lean on
C                                G          C
I just might have a problem that you'd understand
C                       G    C
We all need somebody to lean on


Chorus
