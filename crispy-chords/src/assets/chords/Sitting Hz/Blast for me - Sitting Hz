Blast for me - Sitting Hz

Capo 5


Am   F   G   C  C/B     x4

[Verse 1]
He was born out of wedlock, mom swears she didn’t cheat,
There were three creepy old men, kissing at his feet,
Baby I pray, that someday, 
we can roll in that hay…

[Chorus]
                C
Come hide in my cave
                G
I will keep you Safe
               Am
It’s you I crave
                    F
Yeah I will be your slave
       Dm    C          G
Oh, J.C. Save the last blast for me
Oh, J.C. Save the last blast for me

[Verse 2]
We used to do everything together, just you and I,
Now you’re hangin’ out with the wrong sorts of guys
Come back to me, philosophize
Right into my eyes…

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now they’ve betrayed you, and I’m feeling cross
At the last dinner, I’m mourning my loss
The Romans came, took you away
Oh what did I say?

[Chorus]

Am   G   F   E7

Oh Jesus Christ, come back to life, come back to life, come back to life      x4
