The Crotch-Watcher - Sitting Hz

C#m E B A

The Crotch-Watcher He knows how to dance
The Crotch-Watcher He wants in your pants
The Crotch-Watcher But he won’t make a move
The Crotch-Watcher So he sticks to his groove
The Crotch-Watcher He likes to stare
The Crotch-Watcher I’m quite aware
The Crotch-Watcher His balls are blue
It could be him but I think it’s you

The Crotch-Watcher he’s staring at me
The Crotch-Watcher, I hope I don’t pee
The Crotch-Watcher I bet you’d like that
The Crotch-Watcher your jeans aren’t flat
The Crotch-Watcher, yeah I can do it too
The Crotch-Watcher Now I’m watching you
The Crotch-Watcher Get out of my head
The Crotch-Watcher just touch it instead!

The Crotch-Watcher He knows how to dance
The Crotch-Watcher He wants in your pants
The Crotch-Watcher But he won’t make a move
The Crotch-Watcher so he sticks to his groove
The Crotch-Watcher He likes to stare
The Crotch-Watcher I’m quite aware
The Crotch-Watcher His balls are blue
The Crotch-Watcher I’m on to you

Choose crotch watcher, look at him more and more throughout song and stop on him
Starts in café, more people get creepy as the song goes on
