The Yams Song

Gather round people, come close and come near, I’ve got a tale you might want to hear.
Went down south to start a new life, bought some land from a man and his wife
Went to the market to see what they lack, no yams in sight, time to bring the yams back
Spent my last dollar on GMO seeds, yams for days, that what sign reads

F    G    A
Yams yams yams x2

Perfect, I thought, I planted them quick; soon I had yams the size of a brick
Filled up my cart, and hooked up my horse, went down the hill to the market of course
Try and sell yams and what do I get, a bunch of bad looks and a moldy baguette
Worked all day until closing time, but all these damn yams aint made one goddamn dime

Dm7   G    E
Those damn yams 

Next morning I woke to a knock on the door, Local Man said, “Don’t sell yams anymore.”
I asked him why and he simply replied that thirty years past a stranger came by
He set up at market with yams as his crop, but once they were planted the yams wouldn’t stop
They infested the land, they clogged all the gears, and that’s all we ate for ten fucking years  (clean version ten whole years)

Dm7 G       E
Ten fucking years

He asked of me what seeds I did use, GMO seeds, what does this mean to you?
We reread the packet and soon it was shown, these were the same seeds the last man had sown
But it was too late, the yams were too large, it was obvious now that the yams were in charge
We ran into town like the flash of a storm, it wasn’t too long till the root squad was formed

F    G    A
Yams yams yams
Kill the yams

They slashed and they burned then I heard one man say, if the yams won the fight then I’d have to pay
But for every yam thrashed three more would spring forth, I realized then it was time to head north
Like a sexy young hen, my mind hatched a plan; I went to their farms and stole all their lambs
But on the way back, I checked out my herd, 10 times more lambs, now that’s just absurd

F     G     A
Lambs lambs lambs
Same story with lambs



This town doesn’t want yams it seems, they trod on my hopes, and they’ve trampled my dreams
