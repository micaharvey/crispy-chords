Farmer Refuted - Lin-Manuel Miranda


[SEABURY]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present “Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!”
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

[MULLIGAN]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

[SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don’t let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

[BURR]
Let him be

[SEABURY]
They’re playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame…

[HAMILTON]										  [SEABURY]
Yo!
He’d have you all unravel at the 				  Heed not the rabble
Sound of screams but the 						  Who scream
Revolution is comin’  							  Revolution, they
The have-nots are gonna 						  Have not your
Win this     									  Interests
It’s hard to listen to you with a straight face   At heart

[HAMILTON]										  [SEABURY]
Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, 			  Chaos and bloodshed are
honestly you shouldn’t even talk.  				  Not a
And what about Boston?   						  Solution. Don’t
Look at the cost, n’   							  Let them lead you
all that we’ve lost n’  						  Astray

[SEABURY]
This Congress does not
Speak for me

[HAMILTON]
My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

[SEABURY]
They’re playing a dangerous game

[HAMILTON]
But strangely, your mange is the same

[SEABURY]
I pray the king shows you his mercy

[HAMILTON]
Is he in Jersey?

[SEABURY]
For shame

[HAMILTON]
For the revolution!	 

[SEABURY]
For shame,
 
[COMPANY]
For the revolution!

[SEABURY]
Heed—

[HAMILTON]
If you repeat yourself again I’m gonna—

[SEABURY/HAMILTON]
Scream—

[HAMILTON]
Honestly, look at me, please don’t read!

[SEABURY]
Not your interests—

[HAMILTON]
Don’t modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

[BURR]
Alexander, please!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, I’d rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

[ENSEMBLE]
Silence! A message from the King!
A message from the King!

[FULL COMPANY]
A message from the King!




Alexander Hamilton confronts a loyalist publicly advocating against the American Revolution.

The scene is inspired by a series of anonymous letters to newspapers in New England, with Bishop Samuel Seabury writing as “A Westchester Farmer” (1774) about how destructive revolution against England would be, and Hamilton responding with “A Full Vindication of the Measures of Congress” and later, “The Farmer Refuted,” (1775) from which this song takes its name.

The structure of the song is a musical pun – it makes heavy use of counterpoint, and Hamilton is making counterpoints to Seabury’s arguments. The melody is a clever variation on the classic “Minuet in G” from the “Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach.”

This song also nods at the Amadeus scene in which Mozart’s nemesis, Salieri, painstakingly composes a simple march, and then Mozart, after hearing it once, ad libs a much more complex and sophisticated version, unintentionally humiliating Salieri in the process:

Of course, in this instance Hamilton is purposely dissing Seabury.

As with “You’ll Be Back,” the harpsichord accompaniment provides an old-fashioned feel; as with “Your Obedient Servant,” the waltz time creates an air of formality and sets the scene for an encounter of two people literally or metaphorically circling each other.
