Capo 1

D  Bm  G   A

D                                 Bm         
   I dreamed a dream in time gone by
G                       
   When hope was high
               Em7     A     
And life worth living
D                                  Bm7      
   I dreamed that love would never die
G                              Em7           A
   I dreamed that God would be forgiving
D                          Bm           
   Then I was young and unafraid
G                                    Em7      A6    
   And dreams were made and used and wasted
D                            Bm7              
   There was no ransom to be paid
G                           Em7              A 
   No song unsung, no wine untasted

B                         Em
   But the tigers come at night
B              B7             E       Esus     
   With their voices soft as thunder
A                          Dm
   As they tear your hope apart
A                               D   Em   F#m   G   A           
   And they turn your dream to shame

D                          Bm          
   He slept a summer by my side
G                                 Em7       A
   He filled my days with endless wonder
D                              Bm7        D
   He took my childhood in his stride
G             A6               D    A   Am6   B
   But he was gone when autumn came

E                                  C#m7        
   And still I dream he'll come to me
A                                 F#m7         B
   That we will live the years together
E                                   C#m7       
   But there are dreams that cannot be
A                                 F#m7         B   E
   And there are storms we cannot weather

C#m7        E                  A             
   I had a dream my life would be
F#m7            A         B        E
   So different from this hell I'm living
             E                C#m7            E
So different now from what it seemed
A               B                  E                 
   Now life has killed the dream I dreamed.

E   C#m7   E   A   B   E
