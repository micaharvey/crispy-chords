Intro 
G    D

  G     Em          C        G  
Amazing Grace, How sweet the sound
      G       Em         D
That saved a wretch like me
   G       Bm        C       G    
I once was lost, but now am found
      Em        D     G
T'was blind but now I see

T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear
And Grace, my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
We have already come
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far
And grace will lead us home

Amazing grace, How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
T'was blind but now I see
