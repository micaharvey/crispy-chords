The High Road - Broken Bells


Intro
Dm, C, G


Verse 1
Dm           C          Dm
We're bound to wait all night
             C       Dm
She's bound to run amok
C                     G
Invested enough in it anyhow

To each his own
Dm         C            Dm
The garden needs sorting out
       C                Dm
She curls her lips on the bow
    C                   G
And I don't know if i'm dead or not

To anyone


Come on and get the minimum
Before you open up your eyes
This army has so many heads
to analyze
Come on and get your overdose
Collect it at the borderline
And they want to get up in your head


[Chorus]
Dm           C           G
Cause they know, and so do I
Dm           C           G
The high road is hard to find
Dm           C           G
A detour to your new life
Dm           C           G
Tell all of your friends goodbye

Verse 2
-------
The dawn to end all nights
That's all we hoped it was
A break from the warfare in your house
To each his own
A soldier is bailing out
He curled his lips on the barrel
And I don't know if the dead can talk
To anyone

Come on and get the minimum
Before you open up your eyes
This army has so many hands
Are you one of us?
Come on and get your overdose
Collect it at the borderline
And They want to get up in your head


End (x3)
-----
C                           Am
It's too late to change your mind
        Dm          G
You let loss be your guide
