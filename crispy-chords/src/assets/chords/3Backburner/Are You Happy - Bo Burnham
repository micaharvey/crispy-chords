Are You Happy - Bo Burnham


[Intro]
C Em C Em F G


Am                  Em    F
    Now the show is done
                   C             E                        Am
I hope that you had gut-trembling or something resembling fun
                            Em
And if you watch this thing alone
    F                                               C                   E
You probably didn’t laugh, but maybe a few times you exhaled out of your nose
Am                              Em
    But if you hated it, that’s fair
           F                                           C               G
But either way, could you find a little more time for a parting questionnaire?

C                              E       F
   On a scale from one to zero, are you happy?
C                                         E       F
   ‘Cause you’re on your own from here, so are you happy?
C                          E       F
   I’m open to suggestions, are you happy?
C                            Dm         E7     F
   But what the fuck kind of question is "Am I happy?"

  C                       E       Am
I really wanna try to get happy
                         F
And I think that I could get it if I didn’t always
C                      E       F
Panic every time I’m unhappy like
              C
I’m owed some life
                        E
Where I’m always, like, happy
         Am                            F
Which is stupid ‘cause I wouldn’t even want it if I got it
C                E       F        Fm
Wait, oh god, my dad was right

C                                 E      F
   So if you know or ever knew how to be happy
C                                 E        F
   On a scale from one to two now, are you happy?
C                              E        F
   You’re everything you hated, are you happy?
C                          E        F
   Hey, look Ma, I made it, are you happy?
