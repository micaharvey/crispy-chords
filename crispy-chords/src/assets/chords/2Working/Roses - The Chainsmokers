Roses - The Chainsmokers

E 


[Verse]

E 
Taking it slow, but it's not typical 
E 
He already knows that my love is fire 
E 
His heart was a stone, but then his hands roam 
E 
I turned him to gold and it took him higher 


[Pre-Chorus]

C#m                     A                     E 
Oh, I'll be your daydream, I'll wear your favorite things 
B 
We could be beautiful 
C#m                     A                     E 
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to paradise 
B 
Say you'll never let me go 


[Chorus]

C#m 
Deep in my bones, I can feel you 
A 
Take me back to a time when only we knew 
E B 
Hideaway 
C#m 
We could waste the night with an old film 
                 A 
Smoke a little weed on the couch in the back room 
    E B 
Hideaway 
B                    C#m A E B 
Say you'll never let me go
B                    C#m A E 
Say you'll never let me go
