My Body Is A Cage - Arcade Fire

Capo 1

             F#m
My body is a cage
     A/E                            D
That keeps me from dancing with the one I love
       F#m
But my mind holds the key

             F#m
My body is a cage
     A/E                            D
That keeps me from dancing with the one I love
       F#m
But my mind holds the key

                    F#m
I'm standing on the stage
   A/E                        D
Of fear and self-doubt it's a hollow play
            F#m
But they'll clap anyway

             F#m
My body is a cage
     A/E                            C#
That keeps me from dancing with the one I love 
       D                  Bm
But my mind holds the key
       D/A                 Bm
You're standing next to me
   D/A               Bm
My mind holds the key

                 F#m
I'm living in an age
     A/E
That calls darkness light 
          D
Though my language is dead
          F#m
Still the shapes fill my head

                 F#m
I'm living in an age
      A/E
Whose name I don't know
           D
Though the fear keeps me moving 
         F#m
Still my heart beats so slow

             F#m
My body is a cage
     A/E                            C#
That keeps me from dancing with the one I love
       D                   Bm
But my mind holds the key
       D/A                 Bm
You're standing next to me
   D/A              Bm
My mind holds the key


             F#m  A/E  Bm  F#m
My body is a cage

F#m  A/E  Bm  F#m

             F#m
My body is a cage
    A/E
We take what we're given 
     D
Just because you've forgotten
        F#m
Doesn't mean you're forgiven

                 F#m
I'm living in an age
      A/E
Still turning in the night
           D
But when I get to the doorway 
        F#m
There's no one in sight

                 F#m
I'm living in an age
    A
Realizing I'm dancing 
         C#
With the one I love 
       D                   Bm
But my mind holds the key
D/A                 Bm
standing next to me
   D/A                Bm
My mind holds the key

G                  A
Set my spirit free
Set my spirit free
Set my mind free
Set my spirit free
