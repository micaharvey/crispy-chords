Bm                            A  Asus2
Hello, Is there anybody in there?
G               G/F#    Em                Bm          
Just nod if you can hear me,      is there anyone at home?
Bm                                      A      Asus4
Come on, now, I hear your feeling  down,
      G             G/F#     Em         Bm              
well, I can ease  your  pain,   get you on your feet again.
Bm                      A     Asus4         G               G/F#  Em
relax, I need some information, first,  just the basic facts,
         Bm         
Can you show me where it hurts

D                      A      Asus4
There is no pain you are receding, 
D                             A  Asus2
A distant ships smoke, on the horizon,
C                            G Gadd4      C                                   G Gadd4
You are only coming through in waves, Your lips move, but I can't hear what your saying,
     D                            A      Asus4
When I was a child, I had a fever,
D                                   A  Asus2
  my hands felt just like, two ballons,
C                               G   G*                                    C
Now I've got that feeling once again, I can't explain, you would not understand,
                     G    Gadd4     
This is not how I am,
A         Asus2      C               G                    D
I______________________  have become, comfortably numb.

Bm                      A                         G   G/F#  Em
O.K., just a little pin prick, there'll be no more (scream), 
           Bm
But you may feel a little sick.  Can you stand up?
                   A    Asus4                     G             G/F#  Em
I do believe it's working, good. That'll keep you going throught the show,
Bm
C'mon it's time to go

D                            A  Asus4   D                               A  Asus4
There is no pain you are receding, A distant ships smoke on the horizon,
C                                G Gadd4              C                                      G G*
You are only coming through in waves,     Your lips move, but I can't hear what your 
    D                                    A      Asus4                                           saying,
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse,
D                        A Asus2       C                               G
Out of the corner of my eye,             I turned to look, but it was gone,
                           C
I can not put my finger on it now, 
                            G             Gadd4
The child is grown, the dream is gone,
A               G/B  C                 G                  D      Dsus4
and I___________________, have become comfortably numb.
