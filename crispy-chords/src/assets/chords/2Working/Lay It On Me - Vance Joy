Lay It On Me - Vance Joy
Capo 5 (capo 2 feels good)


[Verse 1]
Am    G/B C
  I'm so gone
F               G
Anyone could see that I'm wasted
Am    G/B   C
  You cut through
    F                G
And I just wanna know what's in your head


[Pre-Chorus]
Am        G/B   C                   F     G
  Write it on a piece of paper, honey
Am        G/B   C            F     G
  Put it in my coat before I go
Am       G/B C                          F     G
  Hidden in a place you know I'll find it
Am        G/B    C             F      G
  Later when I'm sitting all alone


[Chorus]
Am  F  G
Let me in
                            Am  F  G
Everything starts at your skin, so new
                              Am  F
Your love's always finding me ou-out
              G
Who am I kidding?
                         Am  F     G
If all my defences come down, oh baby
                           Am   G/B   C
Will you lay it all on me now?
                  F    Em    G
Lay it all on me now
                  Am   G/B   C
Lay it all on me now
                  F    Em    G
Lay it all on me now


[Verse 2]
Am      G/B   C
  Snow comes down
F                G
Everything is new and different
Am   G/B   C
  I found you
F                     G
Hidden in plain sight, why'd I take so long?


[Pre-Chorus]
Am        G/B   C                   F     G
  Write it on a piece of paper, honey
Am        G/B   C            F     G
  Put it in my coat before I go

[Chorus]
Am  F  G
Let me in
                            Am  F   G
Everything starts at your skin, so new
                              Am  F
Your love's always finding me ou-out
              G
Who am I kidding?
                         Am  F     G
If all my defences come down, oh baby
                           Am   G/B   C
Will you lay it all on me now?
                  F    Em    G
Lay it all on me now
                  Am   G/B   C
Lay it all on me now
                  F    Em    G
Lay it all on me now

Am G/B C  |  F Em G
Ooh ooh ooh

[Chorus]
                              Am  F
Your love's always finding me ou-out
              G
Who am I kidding?
                         Am  F     G
If all my defences come down, oh baby, babe
                           Am   G/B   C
Will you lay it all on me now?
                  F    Em    G
Lay it all on me now
                  Am   G/B   C
Lay it all on me now
                  F    Em    G
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
