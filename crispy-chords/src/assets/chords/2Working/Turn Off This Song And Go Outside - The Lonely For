Welcome to my heart and soul, a miserable excuse to tell the world of all 
 C             E                          C         D
the pain I've caused, Hope you don't forget these songs.

Guys in bands with vintage shirts and hundred dollar pants often think we 
            C       E                     C         D
can do what no one can, we see ourselves above the rest

talent or gifts to bring, that is greater than the orphan or the song she 

sings yeah
 
  C               D                       C                D
