Lover (You don't treat me no good no more)

Well, the truth, well, it hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags and I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split, I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit and ain't never coming back

Yeah, but before I get to going, I've got to say
I know you used to love me but that was yesterday
And the truth, I won't fight it
When the love starts burning, you got to do what's right

Woh oh, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good, no more
Woh oh, woh oh, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more

Well, the truth, yeah, it hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags and I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split, I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit and ain't never coming back

Yeah, but before I get to going, I've got to say
I know you used to love me but that was yesterday
And the truth, I won't fight it
When the love starts burning, you got to do what's right

But before I get to going, I've got to say
There was a time, oh woman, when you used to shake it for me
But now, all you do is just treat me cold
Ain't gonna take it no more, gonna walk out the door

Woh oh, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good, no more
No good, no more, more, more, more
Lover, lover, lover, you don't treat me good, no more
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, I went to your mama's almost every night
And I'm hurting so bad 'cos you don't treat me right
O woman, o woman, you know I love you so
But you're so mean to me, baby, I'm walking out the door
Oh lover, oh lover, yeah, yeah

Woh oh, woh oh, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more

Woh oh, woh oh, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
