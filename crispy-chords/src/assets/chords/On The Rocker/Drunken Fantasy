Drunken Fantasy 

I don't buy it
I don't buy this sale you've got
All your merchandise is on a clock
Your fashion's going out of style
Out of style, yeah
It's been a while, yeah
Since you've been cool
Since you've been cool
It'll be a while, yeah
It'll be a while
Til you get schooled
But until that day comes I know that you
Ain't selling me on your drunken fantasy
Ain't selling me, ooh
I ain't buying this, oh buying this, abyss
Cause you ain't selling me your drunken fantasy
I won't buy, oh nevermore
No Birdie look I gotta
Get out this store
I'll walk the road, like I know best
Don't got one trouble
Tore them all off my chest oh yes
Woahohwoah, yeah
The world don't know, yeah
But you've been cool
You've been cool
It'll be a while, yeah
It'll be a while
Until you're through
But until that day comes I promise you
Ain't selling me on your drunken fantasy
Ain't selling me, ooh
I ain't buying this, oh buying this, abyss
Cause you ain't selling me your drunken fantasy
Fantasy
I see through it all
It comes before the fall
A prideful rise, bound to fall
Mmm
Mmm
I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you are my friend
I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you are my friend
-On
