Wasting Time

Your face impresses, they walk by
Your hair a splash against the sky
No imperfection in their sight
That's just cause they don't see at

Night, when the demons speak to you
There's nothing I can do to drown the space

All I wanted was the same pace of
Growing up and down to stay in bright lights
Going for the trophy at first place, or
Are we wasting time

If I look distracted it's cause you
You get me spinning and leave me blue
And red, a blur in my head
And it's true, oh you're only a mess at

Night, when the demons speak to you
There's nothing I can do to drown the space

All I wanted was the same pace of
Growing up and down to stay in bright lights
Going for the trophy at first place, or
Are we wasting time
Wasting time

All I wanted was the same pace of
Growing up in center stage in bright lights
Going for the trophy at first place, or
Are we wasting time
