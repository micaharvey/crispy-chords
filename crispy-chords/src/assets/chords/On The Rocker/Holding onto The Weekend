Holding onto The Weekend

Should I believe what they tell me
I like to find it out for myself
Are you a friend or an enemy?
Can I be me oh can I be myself

I don’t know how to explain it
You’re just a stranger oh but this could last
I’ll keep my distance contained in
Like I don’t care because I move too fast

Woah don’t you know that I
Can write between the lines?

She’ll be holding on to the weekend
She’ll be hiding from the sunlight
She’ll be holding on to the weekend
She’ll be dancing all night
She’ll be dancing all night
She’ll be dancing all night

She’ll be with them on the rooftop
But only if there’s boys and cheap champagne
She’ll rush past the shortstop
To run around and maybe steal home plate

It doesn’t need explaining
I’m glad I found it out for myself
She’ll be replacing the same thing
But only if her eyes can keep the spell

Woah don’t you know that I
Can write between the lines?

She’ll be holding on to the weekend
She’ll be hiding from the sunlight
She’ll be holding on to the weekend
She’ll be dancing all night
She’ll be dancing all night
She’ll be dancing all night
We’ll be dancing all night
We’ll be dancing all night
She’ll be dancing all night, yeah
She’ll be dancing, dancing
She’ll be dancing
We’ll be dancing all night
She’ll be dancing all night
