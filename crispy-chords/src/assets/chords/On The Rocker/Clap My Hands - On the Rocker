Clap My Hands - On The Rocker
üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè


Pull me in like a drowner, into the water
I better be careful, they might suffocate me, what are they after

Is it my coin or is it my horse?
I'll scream until my voice gets hoarse
But if I drown I don't know who would smile, people would frown

Woah ho, woah oh
Woah, woah, wah

They say you throw a boomerang rang rang, it'll come back to you, ya swing it
Let me swing swing swing, like a bat hittin balls to the moon moon moon
If you zoom in you can see me

Clap my hands
You can hear me screaming your name
At the end of the day
Who's got time to play games
You can see me clappin my hands
You can hear me screaming your name
At the end of the day
Who's got time to play games

Brush me off like a movie star or a prom queen
But if you think twice, you might stop missing what I'm avoiding

Is it your gain or is it my loss?
Somebody made these silent laws
But if I break them I don't know who would smile, people would frown

Woah ho, woah oh
Woah, woah, wah

They say you throw a boomerang rang rang, it'll come back to you, ya swing it
Let me swing swing swing, like a bat hittin balls to the moon moon moon
If you zoom in you can see me

Clap my hands
You can hear me screaming your name
At the end of the day
Who's got time to play games
You can see me clappin my hands
You can hear me screaming your name
At the end of the day
Who's got time to play games
