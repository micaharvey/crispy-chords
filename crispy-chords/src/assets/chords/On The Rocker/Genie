Genie

I don't know what the genie in the bottle holds
I don't know what debt I'll inherit but baby I'm sold
I won't fold, I'll hide my hand but she can see my soul
A one two three four
She said you get three and not one wish more
Hey hey, you can look me in the eyes and be okay
Well okay, but I guess it's time to start watching what I say
I don't play, she stared me down like she knew what was going through my brain

Woah woah where you going child
How long have you been staring in the devil's eyes, oh why

Oh why, now can you give me everything that money can buy
And what about the power money can't buy
I need the world now and I don't know why
I can't wait, can you hand me every fantasy on a gold plate
What do you say, woah I know I need a lot to stay entertained
Oh you, never told me having you around would be so cool
I'm no fool, but they'd imprison me if they could hear me talking to you
I won't lose my head but I know that I'm in way over it

Woah woah where you going child
How long have you been staring in the devil's eyes, oh why

I don't know what the genie in the bottle holds
I don't know what debt I could bear it but baby I'm broke
She said go
At the end of the day it's a broken soul
Some holes don't close, won't fill even til my skin goes cold

Woah woah where you going child
How long have you been staring in the devil's eyes, oh why
