Down In The Valley - The Head and the Heart

(Intro)

F               C           Am            C                     C
I wish I was a slave to an age-old trade
F               C           Am            C                     C
Like ridin' around on railcars and workin' long days
F                           C                           C
Lord have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways
F                      C                                C
Lord have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways


(Intro Again)


F                       C               
Call it one drink too many
Am                              C       C
Call it pride of a man
F                       C               Am        C
But it don't make no difference if you sit or you stand
F (Straight strum)      (stop)                                  C
'Cause they both end in trouble and start with a grin
F (straight strum)      (stop)                                  C
Yeah they both end in trouble and start with a grin


F                  C                    Am                C
We do it over and over and over again
F                   C                Am         C
We do it over and over and over again

 
F       Am      C       G
Oh      -oh     -oh     -oh (slow) (straight strumming)
F       Am      C       
Oh      -oh     -oh     -oh  (build)


F                                    Am
I know there's California, Oklahoma
C                                   G
And all of the places I ain't ever been to but


F
Down in the valley with
Am
Whiskey rivers
C                               G
These are the places you will find me hidin'
F                               Am      
These are the places I will always go ( not slow)
C                               G
These are the places I will always go ( not slow ) 

F
I am on my way ( slow )
Am
I am on my way (slow)
C                               G
I am on my way back to where I started

F       Am      C       G (build)

F       Am      C       G
Oh      -oh     -oh     -oh (straight strumming)


F       Am      C       G
Oh      -oh     -oh     -oh  (build)


F                                               AM
One more for the stars and the eyes of the walls
C                          G    
I saw your face... I heard you callin out

F...............................AM............ (build)

C                           G
I saw your face in the crowd and you came out

F...................AM............ (build)

C                                       G
Just like the sun and the moon and the stars at night
F                               AM
There was a sign on the door and it reads to me to me 
C                                       G
Just like the sun and the moon and the stars at night...

F       Am      C       G
Oh      -oh     -oh     -oh (straight strumming)


F       Am      C       G
Oh      -oh     -oh     -oh


F       
I am on my way (slow)
AM              
I am on my way (slow)

C                               G
I am on my way back to where I started

F                                    Am
I know there's California, Oklahoma
C                                   G
And all of the places I ain't ever been to but

F
Down in the valley with
Am
Whiskey rivers
C                               G
These are the places you will find me hidin'
F                               Am      
These are the places I will always go (slow)
C                               G
These are the places I will always go (slow)
F                                       C
So I wish I was a slave to an age-old trade

Lord have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways
