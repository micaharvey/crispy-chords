   C                   F6
Oh, I've just come from the land of the sun
       G                                   C
From a war that must be won in the name of truth
                                 F6
With our soldiers so brave, your freedom we will save
         G                                      C
With our rifles and grenades and some help from God


C
I want to see my family
F6
My wife and child are waiting for me
G
I've got to go home
                         C
I've been so alone, you see

C                          F6
You just can’t believe the joy I did receive
       G                                    C
When I finally got my leave and I was going home
                                  F6
Oh, I flew through the sky and my convictions could not lie
       G                                     C
For my country I would die and I will see it soon


C
And I want to see my family
F6
My wife and child are waiting for me
G
I've got to go home
                        C
I've been so alone, you see
(Guitar interlude – C F6 G C)

                                  F6
When I walked through the door my wife she laid upon the floor
         G                                       C
And with tears her eyes did soar, I did not know why
                                  F6
Then I looked into her hand and I saw the telegram
          G
Said that I was a brave, brave man but that I was dead


C
I want to see my family
F6
My wife and child are waiting for me
G
I've got to go home
                         C
I've been so alone, you see


C
I want to see my family
F6
My wife and child are waiting for me
G
I've got to go home
                         C
I've been so alone, you see

(End song with guitar - C F6 G C)
