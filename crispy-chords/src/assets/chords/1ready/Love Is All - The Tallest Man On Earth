Love Is All - The Tallest Man On Earth

CAPO 7 



       Em            D/F#             G           C
Well I walk upon the river like it's easier than land
C            G               G       D/F#      Em
Evil's in my pocket and your will is in my hand
         D/F#            G         C    G
Oh, your will is in my hand

         Em              D/F#             G             C
And I'll throw it in the current that I stand upon so still
C                 G                    G          D/F#       Em
Love is all, from what I've heard, but my heart's learned to kill
    D/F#                  G        C     G
Oh, mine has learned to kill

Chorus:
D/F#                G
Oh, I said I could rise
         C             D/F#
From the harness of our goals
              Am
Here come the tears
         D/F#                G   C      G   C     G
But like always, I let them go
              C   G  D/F#  G
Just let them go


       Em            D/F#             G           C
And now spikes will keep on falling from the heavens to the floor
C            G               G           D/F#  Em
The future was our skin and now we don't dream anymore
         D/F#            G          C    G
No, we don't dream anymore

         Em              D/F#             G             C
Like a house made from spider webs and the clouds rolling in
C                 G                    G                     Em
I bet this mighty river's both my savior and my sin
    D/F#                  G     C     G
Oh, my savior and my sin

Chorus:
D/F#                G
Oh, I said I could rise
         C             D/F#
From the harness of our goals
              Am
Here come the tears
         D/F#                G  C   G
But like always, I let them go
              C   G  D/F#  G
Just let them go

       Em            D/F#            G           C
Well I walk upon the river like it's easier than land
C            G               G             Em
Evil's in my pocket and your strength is in my hand
         D/F#            G          D/F#    G
Oh, your strength is in my hand

         Em              D/F#             G             C
And I'll throw it in the current that I stand upon so still
C                 G                    G                     Em
Love is all, from what I've heard, but my heart's learned to kill
    D/F#                  G        C   G 
Oh, mine has learned to kill

Chorus:
D/F#                G
Oh, I said I could rise
         C             D/F#
From the harness of our goals
              Am
Here come the tears
         D/F#                G   C G
But like always, I let them go
              C   G  D/F#  G
Just let them go
