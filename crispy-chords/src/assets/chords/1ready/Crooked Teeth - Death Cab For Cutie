[Verse 1]
Em7  A7  C            G             Em7 A7        C      G
It   was one hundred degrees, as we sat beneath a willow tree, 
      Em7          A7              C           G        Em7        A7       C    G
Who's tears didn't care, they just hung in the air, and refused to fall, to fall. 

(base comes in , same chord sequence)
Em7      A7            C        G
   And I knew I'd made horrible call, 
   Em7          A7                   C      G
And now the state line felt like the Berlin wall, 
          Em7    A7                C          G
And there was no doubt about which side I was on. Hmmm.....

   [Em]   [EmMaj7/D#]    [Em7/D]    [B7]   
    Cause I built you a home in my heart,         
        [Em] [EmMaj7/D#]  [Em7/D]      [A7]
     With rotten wood, It decayed from the start

[Chorus]
C         G                   D         
Cause you can't find nothing at all,    
If there was nothing there all along.   
No you can't find nothing at all,       
If there was nothing there all along.   

Bass fill.....

Em7      A7       C          G
       I braved treacherous streets, 
And kids strung out on homemade speed. 
And we shared a bed in which I could not sleep, 
At all, woo, hoo, woo, hooOoOo. 

Em7      A7        C        G
Cause at night the sun in retreat, 
Made the skyline look like crooked teeth, 
In the mouth of a man who was devouring, us both. 


You're so cute when you're slurring your speech, 
But they're closing the bar and they want us to leave. 

[Chorus]
C         G                   D         
Cause you can't find nothing at all,    
If there was nothing there all along.   
No you can't find nothing at all,       
If there was nothing there all along. 

[Bridge]
A7            B7
I'm a war, of head versus heart, 
          Em7        A7
And it's always this way. 
   A7               B7
My head is weak, my heart always speaks, 
Em7                       C     G    D
Before I know what it will say. 

CHORUS
