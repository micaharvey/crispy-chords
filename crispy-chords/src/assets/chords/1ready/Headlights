Cmaj7  G                  Em          D      G

              Cmaj7

You know I'll be waiting on the
D     G

                Cmaj7

C             G
  don't be a fool 
                    D

C              G
  I know it's cool
                    D 
but it's only light
C            G
  baby with you 
                D
I can never lie
C            G
  don't go chasing 
                   D
all the headlights


Verse:

Cmaj7  G                Em         D  G            
Oh I could feel the beating of your heart on drum

Cmaj7  G                Em         D  G            
Oh don't know if I'm dreaming or if you have gone

               Cmaj7  
every time you go

G                Em         D  G            
Hits me like a bullet from a golden gun

               Cmaj7  
Yeah I know it's cold

G                Em         D  G            
but if you stay then I could keep you warm at night


Chorus
