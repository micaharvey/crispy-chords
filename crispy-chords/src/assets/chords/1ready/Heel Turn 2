Spend too much of my life
Now trying to play fair

Throw my better self overboard
Shoot at him when he comes up for air

Come unhinged
Get revenge
I don’t wanna die in here

Let all the trash rain down
From way up in the rafters

Don’t care what comes after

Torch the bridge
I don’t wanna die in here

I don’t wanna die in here
