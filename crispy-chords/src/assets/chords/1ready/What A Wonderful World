What A Wonderful World

     F         Am    Bb         Am
I see trees of green, red roses too
Gm7        F     A7         Dm
I see them bloom, for me and you,
      Db              Gm7/C    C7        F  / F+ / Bbmaj7 / C7 /
And I think to myself, What a  wonderful world.

I see skies of blue and clouds of white,
The bright blessed day, I like the dark,      (the dark sacred night)
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world (F / Bb / / / F /)

    C7                        F
The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
    C7                   F
Are also on the faces of people goin' by
      Dm              C              Dm         C
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"
Dm                C       Gm7         C7
They're really saying,  "I   love    you."   I hear

(back to verse chords)

Babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know,
And I think to myself what a wonderful world(F / Am7b5 / )

D7       Gm7             Gm7/C   C7b9      F    Bb6  F
   Yes I think to myself, what a wonderful world.
