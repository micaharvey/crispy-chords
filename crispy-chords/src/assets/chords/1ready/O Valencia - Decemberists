O Valencia - Decemberists

Intro:  C - Cmaj7 - G / C - Cmaj7 - G

      C-Cmaj7     G
You belong to the gang

        C-Cmaj7              G
And you say you can’t break away

        C-Cmaj7      G          C-Cmaj7  G
But I’m here with my hands on my heart

    C-Cmaj7        G
Our families can’t agree

         C-Cmaj7            G
I’m your brother’s sworn enemy

         C-Cmaj7        G       C-Cmaj7  G
But I’ll shout out my love to the stars


------------------------------


   Am           F             Dm           G
So wait for the stone on your window, your window

Am          F       Dm        G
Wait by the car and we’ll go, we’ll go


------------------------------


Intro again:  C - Cmaj7 - G / C - Cmaj7 - G


     C-Cmaj7       G
When first we laid eyes

  C-Cmaj7           G
I swore to no compromise

       C-Cmaj7    G         C-Cmaj7  G
‘Til I felt my caress on your skin

          C-Cmaj7        G
Well, how soon we were betrayed

     C-Cmaj7         G
Your sister gave us away

         C-Cmaj7     G    C-Cmaj7  G
And your father came all unhinged


------------------------------


   Am           F             Dm           G
So wait for the stone on your window, your window

Am          F       Dm        G
Wait by the car and we’ll go, we’ll go


------------------------------


    C      Em       Am
But Oh, Valencia-ah-ah!

          F                       C
With your blood still warm on the ground

  Em        Am
Valencia-ah-ah!

      F
And I swear to the stars

     Dm                   G
I’ll burn this whole city down, oh oh ohhh


------------------------------


Intro once again:  C - Cmaj7 - G / C - Cmaj7 - G  x2


      C-Cmaj7     G
All I heard was a shout

        C-Cmaj7            G
Of your brother calling me out

        C-Cmaj7    G        C-Cmaj7  G
And you ran like a fool to my side

         C-Cmaj7      G
Well the shot, it hit hard

         C-Cmaj7               G
And your frame went limp in my arms

        C-Cmaj7 G               C-Cmaj7  G
And the lull of love was your dying cry


------------------------------


   Am           F             Dm           G
So wait for the stone on your window, your window

Am          F       Dm        G
Wait by the car and we’ll, go we’ll go


------------------------------


    C     Em        Am
But Oh, Valencia-ah-ah!

          F                       C
With your blood still warm on the ground

  Em        Am
Valencia-ah-ah!

         F                    C
And I’ll burn this whole city down

  Em        Am
Valencia-ah-ah!

          F                         C
With your blood gettin' cold on the ground

  Em        Am
Valencia-ah-ah!

      F
And I swear to the stars

     Dm                   G                C
I’ll burn this whole city down, oh oh oh
