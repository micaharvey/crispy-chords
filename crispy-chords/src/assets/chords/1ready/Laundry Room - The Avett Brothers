Laundry Room - The Avett Brothers

I created these chords, because I really love this song and the chords that are on
Ultimate-Guitar so far, are in my opinion a bit too much simplified and don't really honor
this great song. This is still way more simplified than the original, but it gets pretty 
far with one guitar.
Try fiddling around with some transfers, e.g.
0-2-3 on the E-String before playing the G-Chord at the beginning of a line,
0-2-3 on the A-String before playing the C-Chord at the beginning of a line,
that really fires up the whole song :)


INTRO:                           G-Chord
