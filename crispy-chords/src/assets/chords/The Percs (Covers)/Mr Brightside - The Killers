Intro:
C   C/B   F ( x 2 )


C                C/B
Coming out of my cage  
                          F
And I've been doing just fine
                   
Gotta gotta be down
                   C
Because I want it all 

C                     C/B
It started out with a kiss
                         F 
How did it end up like this?
                
It was only a kiss
                C
It was only a kiss

                C/B
Now I'm falling asleep
                     F
And she's calling a cab
                      
While he's having a smoke
                       C
And she's taking the drag 
                  C/B
Now they're going to bed
                  F
And my stomach is sick
                   
And it's all in my head
                        Am
But she's touching his chest now 
                   G
He takes off her dress now
       F
Let me go
 Am            
And I just can't look
      G
It's killing me
       F
And taking control 


C
Jealousy
F                Am
Turning saints into the sea
G                     C
Turning (swimming) through sick lullaby
F               Am
Joking on your alibi
G                  C
But it's just the price I pay
F          Am
Destiny is calling me
G           C            F
Open up my eager eyes
Am        G       
I'm Mr. Brightside 


C   F  Am   G  ( x 4 )


( Repeat from start )


I never
   C  F  Am  G ( repeat )
