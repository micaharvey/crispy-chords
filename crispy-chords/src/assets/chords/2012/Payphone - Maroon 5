Payphone - Maroon 5

Capo 4

         C                  G
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
          Em                D
All of my change I spent on you
               C
Where have the times gone
          G                        Em                D
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?

       C
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
G
The people we used to be
Em
It's even harder to picture
D
That you're not here next to me
C
You say it's too late to make it
G
But is it too late to try?
Em
And in our time that you wasted
D                           C
All of our bridges burned down

C              G
I've wasted my nights
                   Em
You turned out the lights
            D
Now I'm paralyzed
                    C                      G
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
             Em          D
But even the sun sets in paradise

         C                  G
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
          Em                D
All of my change I spent on you
               C
Where have the times gone
              G                    Em                D   
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
 
              C         G
If happy ever after did exist
                 Em               D
I would still be holding you like this
          C                      G
All those fairytales are full of sh*t
                Em                D
One more stupid love song I'll be sick

C                               
You turned your back on tomorrow
G
Cause you forgot yesterday
Em
I gave you my love to borrow
D
But just gave it away
C
You can't expect me to be fine
G
I don't expect you to care
Em
I know I've said it before, but
D                         C
All of our bridges burned down

C              G
I've wasted my nights
                   Em
You turned out the lights
            D
Now I'm paralyzed
                      C                      G
Still stucked in that time when we called it love
             Em              D
But even the sun sets in paradise

             C
Now I'm at a payphone...
[Wiz Khalifa]
                     Man work that sh*t
G
I'll be out spending all this money while you sitting round
Em                                           
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
D
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunning
C           
And all of my cars start with the push up a button
G
Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it
Em
Switched the number to my phone
So you never could call it
D
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it I'm ballin'
C
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
G                                                 Em
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
D
Or what you could've saw
But sad to say it's over for
C
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
G
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Em
Now ask me who they want
                            D
So you can go and take that little piece of sh*t with you

         C                  G
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
          Em                D

               C
Where have the times gone
          G                        Em                D

              C          G
