We Found Love - Rihanna

Capo 6

Am               F
Yellow diamonds in the light 

C                  G
And we're standing side by side 

Am             F
As your shadow crosses mine 

C                G        Am - F
What it takes to come aliiiivvveee..

C                        G             Am - F
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't denyyyy 

C              G
But I've gotta let it go 

Am                  F
We found love in a hopeless place 

C                  G
We found love in a hopeless place 

Am                 F
We found love in a hopeless place 

C                  G
We found love in a hopeless place 

Repeat the same chords as the rest sounds exactly the same :)

Shine a light through an open door 
Love and life I will divide 
Turn away cause I need you more 
Feel the heartbeat in my mind 

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny 
But I've gotta let it go 

We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place
