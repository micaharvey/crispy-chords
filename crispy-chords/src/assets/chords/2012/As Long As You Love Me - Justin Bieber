F          G
Take my chances

Verse 2:
I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day
For your dreams girl

I'll be your Hova                           
You can be my Destiny's Child 
on the scene girl

So don't stress
Don't cry
We don't need no wings to fly
Just take my hand

Chorus:
As you love me
We could be starving
We could be homeless
We could be broke

As long as you love me

I'll be your silver
I'll be your gold

As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Am                                  F                       G
I don't know if this makes sense but, you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, I'll rendezvous it
I'll fly you to it, I'll beat you there
Girl, you know I got you

Us, trust, a couple things I can't spell without U
Now we on top of the world, cause that's just how we do
Use to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view
Man, we stepping out like woa (Oh God!), cameras point and shoot
Ask me 'what's my best side?', I stand back and point at you

You the one that I argue with, feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But, the grass ain't always greener on the other side, it's green where you water it
So I know, we got issues baby, true, true, true
But I'd rather work on this you than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me


Chorus:

As you love me
We could be starving
We could be homeless
We could be broke

As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum
I'll be your silver
I'll be your gold

As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love me
