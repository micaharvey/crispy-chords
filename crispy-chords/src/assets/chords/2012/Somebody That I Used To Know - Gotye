Somebody That I Used To Know - Gotye
  
capo 5 version
Am, G, F

Intro: Am, G, Am, G x5

Verse:
Am      G      Am G    Am   G Am  G
Now and then I think of when we were together
       
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
    
Told myself that you were right for me

But felt so lonely in your company

But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

Am, G, Am, G x4

Verse 2:
Am, G, Am, G, Am,G, Am, G
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness

Like resignation to the end

Always the end

So when we found that we could not make sense

Well you said that we would still be friends

But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

Chorus:
Am      G              F    G
But you didn't have to cut me off
Am       G          F
Make out like it never happened
         G          Am
And that we were nothing
    G             F       G
And I don't even need your love
         Am              G
But you treat me like a stranger
          F       G
And that feels so rough

You didn't have to stoop so low

Have your friends collect your records
  
And then change your number
 
I guess that I don't need that though

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Verse 3:
Am       G             Am                  G          Am  G Am G      
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
Am          G                Am              G      Am   G Am G
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
Am       G       F          G       
And I don't wanna live that way
Am       G       F          G   
Reading into every word you say
Am       G       F          G   
You said that you could let it go
Am       G       F          G   
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...

Chorus:
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know


Am  G    F  G
I used to know
Am   G    F   G
That I used to know x2

Am    G   F   G
Somebody...

Ends on Am
