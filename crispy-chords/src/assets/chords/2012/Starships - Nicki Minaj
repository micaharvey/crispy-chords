Starships - Nicki Minaj

Capo 2
C, G, F, Am, Em, F

Verse:
                C
Let's go to the beach, each
Let's go get away
G         F
They say, what they gonna say?
        Am
Have a drink, clink, found the bud light
   Em                  F
Bad bitches like me, is hard to come by
    C
The patron on, let's go get it on
  G          F
The zone on, yes, I'm in the zone
     Am   
Is it two, three? Leave a good tip
      Em                     F
I'mma blow all my money and don't give two shits

Pre Chorus:
            C
I'm on the floor, floor
 G          F
I love to dance
           Am                Em    F
So give me more more, till I can't stand
             C
Get on the floor, floor
          G          F
Like it's your last chance
             Am
If you want more, more
     Em     F
Then here I am

Chorus
C                G       F
Starships were meant to fly
Am             Em       F
Hands up, and touch the sky
C                    G       F
Can't stop, 'cause we're so high
Am            Em       F
Let's do this one more time
C                G      F
Starships were meant to fly
Am              Em       F
Hands up, and touch the sky
C              G      F
Let's do this one last time
Am    
Can't stop..
(We're higher than a motherfucker)

Breakdown:

Am Am Am Am

Verse:

Jump in my hoopty hoopty hoop
I own that
And I ain't paid my rent this month
I owe that
But fuck who you want, and fuck who you like
Dance our life, there's no end in sight
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

Now everybody let me hear you say ray ray ray
Now spend all your money 'cause they pay pay pay
And if you're A G, you A G,G,G!
My name is Onika, you can call me Nicki

Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Can't stop, 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop..

(We're higher than a motherfucker)
(We're higher than a motherfucker)
(We're higher than a motherfucker)

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Can't stop, 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop..
