Lights - Ellie Goulding	

Capo 4

(Am)     Em       D           C           Am
I had a way then losing it all on my own 
         Em        D                       C           Am
I had a heart then but the queen has been overthrown 
        Em              D      C              Am          
And I'm not sleeping now the dark is too hard to beat
        Em             D        C             Am
And I'm not keeping now the strength I need to push me 
 
Chorus:                
    Em                     D
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
     C                      Am
You shine It when I'm alone
            Em               D 
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong 
    C                        Am
And dreaming when they're gone 
               Em                        D
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home 
C                    Am
Calling, calling, calling home 
             Em                  D
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
    C                 Am
You shine It when I'm alone 


Em       D        C           Am
Noises, I play within my head 
         Em           D                   C          Am
Touch my own skin and hope that I'm still breathing 
    Em               D       C               Am
And I think back to when my brother and my sister slept
Em              D      C              Am
in an unlocked place the only time I feel safe 
  
           Em                  D
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
    C                Am
You shine It when I'm alone
         Em               D
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong 
    C                    Am
And dreaming when they're gone 
               Em                        D
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home 
  C                       Am
Calling, calling, calling home 
             Em                  D
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
    C                 Am
You shine It when I'm alone 
Em
Home 

Interlude
Em, D, C, Am (repeat)

             Em                  D
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
    C                 Am
You shine It when I'm alone
         Em               D
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong 
    C                    Am
And dreaming when they're gone 
               Em                        D
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home 
 C                      Am
Calling, calling, calling home 
             Em                  D
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
    C                Am
You shine It when I'm alone
