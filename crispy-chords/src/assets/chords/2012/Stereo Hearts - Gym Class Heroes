Stereo Hearts - Gym Class Heroes

Capo 2

[Adam Levine]
Em  C         G
My heart's a stereo
               D               Em
It beats for you, so listen close
      C                 G         D
Hear my thoughts in every note, oh oh.
Em C     G
Make me your radio
       D                    Em
Turn me up when you feel low
  C                               G
This melody was meant for you
           D
Just sing along to my stereo (pause)

[Travie McCoy]
                  Em                             C
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
                 G                                    D
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
                    Em                                    C
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
                      G                              D
Like it read well, check it Travie, I can handle that
               Em                                    C
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
                    G                                    D
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
                      Em                               C
I used to used to used to used to, now Iâ€™m over that
                         G                              D
Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

                    Em                                  C
If I could only find a note to make you understand
                   G                                        D
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
                  Em                                      C
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
              G                                    D
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus]
Em  C             G
My heart's a stereo
             D                      Em
It beats for you, so listen close
      C                 G                D
Hear my thoughts in every note, oh oh
Em   C      G
Make me your radio
        D                          Em
Turn me up when you feel low
         C                       G
This melody was meant for you
                 D
Just sing along to my stereo
G               D
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Em             C  D                          G
Oh oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo

[Travie McCoy]
        Em                               C
If I was an old-school fifty pound boombox
                 G                               D
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk
                Em                                  C
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops
                   G                             D
And crank it higher everytime they told you to stop
                      Em                        C
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
                    G                        D
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
               Em                           C
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
                     G                            D
You never know we come and go like on the interstate

                   Em                           C
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
                 G                                D
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
                               Em                           C
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
                       G                              D
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus]
Em C        G
My heart's a stereo
            D                     Em
It beats for you, so listen close
       C                     G                 D
Hear my thoughts in every note, oh oh
Em     C        G
Make me your radio
       D                       Em
Turn me up when you feel low
     C                        G
This melody was meant for you
         D
Just sing along to my stereo
G                 D
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Em           C  D                     G
Oh oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo


[Bridge]
Em    C               G                D
I only pray you'll never leave me behind (never leave me)
Em       C                  G              D
Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find)
Em       C                 G                     D
I take your hand and pull it closer to mine
Em            C                   G                  D
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind

[Chorus]
Em C       G
My heart's a stereo
        D                  Em
It beats for you, so listen close
      C               G                 D
Hear my thoughts in every note, oh oh
Em     C        G
Make me your radio
        D                    Em
Turn me up when you feel low
         C                    G
This melody was meant for you
           D
Just sing along to my stereo
G               D
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Em         C  D                G
Oh oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo
