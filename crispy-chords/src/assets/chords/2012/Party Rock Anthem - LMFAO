Em                            D             C    
On the rise to the top, no lead in our zeppelin, hey

Bridge:
Step up fast and be the first girl to make me throw this cash
We gettin' money, don't be mad now, stop, hatin' is bad


Em                    D
One more shot for us, another round
Em                    D
Please fill up my cup, don't mess around
Em                    D    
We just wanna see you shake it now
Em                    D
Now you wanna be, you're naked now
