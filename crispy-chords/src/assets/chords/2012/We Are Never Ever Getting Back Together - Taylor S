Cadd9 G 
I remember when we broke up the first time 
D Em7
saying this is it I've had enough cause like 
Cadd9 G 
we haven't seen each other in a month 
D Em7
when you said you needed space what?

Cadd9 G
Then you come around again and say
D Em7 
baby I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change
Cadd9 G
Trust me remember how that lasted for a day
D Em7 
I say I hate you we break up you call me I love you

Cadd9 G D Em7
Ooh we called it off again last night 
Cadd9 G D Em7

Cadd9 G D Em7 D/F#
We are never ever ever getting back together
Cadd9 G D Em7 D/F#

You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me 
Cadd9 G D D

Cadd9 G D Em7

Cadd9 G
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
D Em7
and me falling for it screaming that I'm right
Cadd9 G
And you hide away and find your peace of mind 
D Em7
with some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Cadd9 G D Em7

Cadd9 G D Em7 D/F#
Ooh, ooh,

(quietly, but getting louder) 
Cadd9 G D Em7
I used to think that we were forever ever 
Cadd9 G D Em7
and I used to say never say never
Cadd9 G D Em7
