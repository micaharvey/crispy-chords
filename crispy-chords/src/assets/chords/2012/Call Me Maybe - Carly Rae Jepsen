Call Me Maybe - Carly Rae Jepsen
  
Cadd9
I threw a wish in the well
G
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
Em7
I looked at you as it fell
D                     Dsus4
And now you're in my way

Cadd9
I'd trade my soul for a wish
G
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
Em7
I wasn't looking for this
D                    Dsus4
But now you're in my way

Cadd9                                    G
Your stare was holding, ripped jeans - skin was showin'
Em7
Hot night, wind was blowin' 
D                                     Dsus4
Where you think you're going, baby?

Cadd9    G        D                     Dsus4
Hey I just met you and this is crazy
Cadd9     G                     D       Dsus4
But here's my number - so, call me maybe?

Cadd9      G               D      Dsus4
It's hard to look right at you, baby
Cadd9    G                   D             Dsus4
But here's my number - so, call me maybe?

C                   D
Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
Em                    D
But here's my number - so, call me maybe?

Cadd9      G             D         Dsus4
And all the other boys try to chase me
Cadd9       G                   D        Dsus4
But here's my number - so, call me maybe?

Cadd9     
You took your time with the call
G
I took no time with the fall
Em7
You gave me nothing at all
D                      Dsus4
But still you're in my way

Cadd9
I beg and borrow and steal
G
Have foresight and it's real
Em7
I didn't know I would feel it
D         Dsus7
But it's in my way

Cadd9                                                          G
Your stare was holding, ripped jeans - skin was showin'
Em7
Hot night, wind was blowin'

Before you came into my life
                                       Em7
I missed you so bad, I missed you so bad
D                     Dsus4
I missed you so, so bad

Cadd9                                  G
Before you came into my life
                                        Em7
I missed you so bad and you should know that
