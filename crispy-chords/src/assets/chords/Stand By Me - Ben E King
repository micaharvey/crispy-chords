Stand By Me - Ben E King


 BEN E. KING - STAND BY ME

C   Am   F  G   C

  When the night has come
  And the land is dark
  And the moon is the only light we'll see
  No, I won't be afraid,
  No, I won't be afraid
  Just as long as you stand, stand by me.

Chorus:

So, darling, darling, stand by me,
Oh, stand by me.
Oh, stand, stand by me,
Stand by me.

  If the sea that we look upon
  Should tumble and fall
  Or the mountain should crumble in the sea,
  I won't cry, I won't cry,
  No, I won't shed a tear
  Just as long as you stand, stand by me.

Chorus
