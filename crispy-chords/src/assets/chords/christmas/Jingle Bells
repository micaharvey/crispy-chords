1. Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh,
                                G    G7                    C
    oÂ´er the fields we go, laughing all the way.
                                                             F
    Bells on bobtail ring, making spirits bright,
                              G                      G7                     C
    what fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight.
 
  C
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way,
 F                    C                   D                        G   - G7
oh, what fun it is to run in a one-horse open sleigh.
  C
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way,
 F                    C                   G             G7      C
oh, what fun it is to run in a one-horse open sleigh.
 
         C                                                    F
2. A day or two ago, I thought I`d take a ride,
                                         G             G7                 C
    and soon Miss Fanny Bright was seated by my side.
                                                                                        F
    The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot,
                           G                      G7                 C
    we got into a drifted band and we, we got upset.  
 
  C
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way,
 F                    C                   D                        G    - G7
oh, what fun it is to run in a one-horse open sleigh.
  C
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way,
 F                    C                   G              G7     C
oh, what fun it is to run in a one-horse open sleigh.
