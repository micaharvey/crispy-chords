Last Christmas

Capo 2

  C                                     
Last Christmas I gave you my heart,
             Am
but the very next day you gave it away,
Dm            
this year to save me from tears,
       G
I'll give it to someone special.  (2x)
 
  C                              ^
1.   Once bitten and twice shy,
Am                                      ^     ^   
    I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye,
Dm                      \
    Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
 G                            \            \
    Well, it's been a year,  it doesn't surprise me.
 C      
    (Happy Christmas) I wrapped it up and sent it,
   Am                           \                        \
    with a note saying, "I love you" , I meant it,
     Dm    
    now I know what a fool I've been,
                      G              \                            \
    but-if-you-kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again.  
 
+ CHORUS
 
  C           ^                                     ^
2.   A crowded room, friends with tired eyes,
Am      ^                                       
    I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice.
Dm                  \                         \                         
    My God I thought you were someone to rely on.
     G
    Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on.
         C                                \               \
    A face on a lover with a fire-in-his-heart
       Am                                                            Dm     
    a man under cover but you tore  - me -  ap..art, uhu
                     G                                            \
    Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again.
 
+ CHORUS
 
          C
3. A face on a lover with a fire in his heart,
       Am
    a man under cover but you tore him apart
 Dm                                 G
    maybe next year,  I'll give it to someone,  
                                          C
    I'll give it to someone special.
