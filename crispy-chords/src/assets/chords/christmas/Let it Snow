Let it Snow
 
                    D              A         D
1. Oh, the weather outside is frightful,
                          F      A
    but the fire is so delightful,
           Em                     B7       Em
    and since we've no place to go,
               A               A7               D                     
    let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
 
               D                  A            D
2. Oh it doesn't show signs of stopping,
                                      F           A
    and I brought some corn for popping,
         Em                        B7           Em
    the lights are turned way down low,
               A               A7               D
    let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
 
                 A
When we finally kiss good night,
          Bm              E              A
how I hate going out in the storm.
            /
But if you really hold me tight,
B7               E                  A        - A7
all the way home I'll be warm.
 
                D         A        D
3. Oh the fire is slowly dying,
                                      F              A
    and, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing,
              Em               B7        Em
    but as long as you love me so.
               A               A7              D
    let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
