We three Kings of Orient are

1. We three kings of Orient are, bearing gifts we traverse afar,
     G            D               G                          Am           B7       Em
    field and fountain, moor and mountain, following yonder star.
 
 D - D7      G                      C        G                                C        G
O.......o ! Star of wonder, star of night, star with royal beauty bright,
 Em            D          C          D           G                     C         G
westward leading still proceeding, guide us to thy perfect light !
 
     Em                   B7                Em                            B7             Em
2. Born a king on Bethlehem’s plain, gold I bring to crown him again,
      G       D         G                    Am       B7    Em
    King forever, ceasing never, over us all to reign.
 
      Em                    B7           Em                             B7    Em
3. Frankincense to offer have I,     incense owns a deity neigh.
       G                 D         G                        Am                B7           Em
    Prayer and  praising, all men raising, worship Him, God most high.

4. Myrrh is mine, it's bitter perfume, breathes a life of gathering gloom,
      G              D             G                     Am                 B7           Em
    sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying, sealed in the stone cold tomb.
