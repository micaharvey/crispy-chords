Capo 7  

[Intro]
Em G D A [2X]

Em                      G
Robert's got a quick hand
      D                             A
He'll look around the room he won't tell you his plan
Em                    G
Got a rolled cigarette
D                             A  
Hangin' out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
      Em                     G
Yeah, found a six-shooter gun
       D                         A
In his dads closet hidden with a box of fun things
Em                    G
I don't even know what
         D                         A
But he's comin' for you, yeah he's comin for you, hey


[Chrous]
Em                          G
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
             D
You'd better run, better run
A
Outrun my gun
Em                          G
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
             D
You'd better run, better run
A
Faster than my bullet                

[Verse 1]
    We laughing at ya, 
talkin' bout you tho we askin out when
We know you be hustlin' backwards, 
Electric Slide and rewind

My pockets is looking like rerun 
I've begun to dethrone, 
you sippin' on that Seagram's 
Talkin' bout you gone kill somethin'

Y'all must think they real or somethin' 
Go on ahead and pop a pill or somethin'
You ain't fuckn' with me, might as well OD
So after that one, take ten times three

Danny Brown bitch and that boy Rustie 
Got the game on lock like we changed the keys
    can't get in it, whore wore out, 
treat that mouth like police raid a house

Bust ALL up in it, nuts all in it 
Brand new tenant, moved all up in it
Cash no lease, this ain't rented 
Came back now, it's OG-scented

    Who the fuck you think ya'll is 
I'm a grown ass man, I don't play with no kids
Back in 2003 used to post up a rolled up 
bag of pounds to the meat

Used to trap O.T. with the D, 
on the Greyhound bus one pair of jeans
sat down in the city like "hitta where the fiends?" 
Now I do the same thing but it's just 16s

Get money my hitta like I'm 'posed-ta, 
if I donâ€™t then I might go postal
Back a hitta down like Howard tryna post you
If you play around a hitta might smoke you

Beware what you say in the vocals 
Hood starving, everybody going loco
Gotta put a pussy hitta in a chokehold 
No joke that's the code of survival

Battle Royale - everybody your rival
In the ghetto everybody going psycho


[Chrous]
Em                          G
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
             D
You'd better run, better run
A
Outrun my gun
Em                          G
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
             D
You'd better run, better run
A
Faster than my bullet   


[Verse 2: Danny Brown]

    I'm a maniac, 
brainiac when I'm aiming at
Knock your brain out your hat when I cock that
You can't block that, it's just brain out hat

Stop that, you ain't 'bout that
Send my people where ya house at
Couple stacks and a couple packs, 
put your daughter's fingers in a mouse trap

Off that cause we on one
Can't come back like you stole somethin'
Hitta might as well, let me hold somethin'
Before I take that and your ho for frontin'

Pull up like smoke somethin'
Zip of OG, might roast somethin'
Pop a bottle, might toast somethin'
Hitta keep hatin', I'mma toast somethin'

Whipping out that Black and Decker
Putting lean in my Dr. Pepper
Chess shit and you playing checkers
Hit ya chest, now for help ya desperate

Mac attack on that ho shit, 
might ruck around, get your throat split
If you don't know shit, better know this
Fuck around, hocus-pocus

You a focus, I'm a locus, 
see the big picture stay focused
Your ho look atrocious, 
my bitches look ferocious

Breakin' shit, you can't coast this
You idiots talkin' about practice
Roll around with that acid, 
if you don't know start axin

Middle man be taxin', 
made a couple hundred, kept stackin'
Know it sound like I'm braggin' 
but I know you get them racks in

I ain't gotta say shit, 
tell your bitch to suck my dick
I ain't gotta say shit, 
tell your bitch to suck my dick

[Chorus]
Em                          G
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
             D
You'd better run, better run
A
Outrun my gun
Em                          G
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
             D
You'd better run, better run
A
Faster than my bullet 
[Repeat]
