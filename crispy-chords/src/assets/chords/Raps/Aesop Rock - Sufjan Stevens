Aesop Rock - Sufjan Stevens
None Shall Pass - Star of Wonder

Dm  C  Bb  Am

[Verse 1]
Flash that buttery gold, jittery zeitgeist
Wither by the watering hole, Border patrol
What are we to Heart Huckabee Art fuckery suddenly *
Not enough young in his lung for the water wings *

Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch
Like I'm a pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt *
(Fine), sign of the time we elapse
When a primate climb up a spine and attach *

Eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
So when a dogfight's hog-tied prize sort of costs a life
The mouths water on a fork and knife *

And the allure isn't right (No) score on a war-torn beach
Where the cash cow's actually beef *
Blood turns wine when it leak for police
Like that's not a riot it's a feast, let's eat 

[Hook]
And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by the funhouse cast *
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky like none shall pass *
None shall pass
None shall pass

[Sufjan]
I call you
From the comet's cradle

I found you
Trembling by yourself

When the night falls
Lightly on your right-wing shoulder

Wonderful know-it-all
Slightly where the night gets colder

[Verse 2]
Now if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz *
How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz
Cause he wouldn't play rollover fetch like a bitch *

And express no regrets, though he isn't worth a homeowner's piss
To the jokers who pose by the glitz *
(Fine) sign of the swine in the swarm
When a king is a whore who comply and conform

Miles outside of the eye of the storm
With a siphon to lure out a prize and award
While avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war *
True blue triumph is more

Like wait, let him snake up out of the centerfold
Let it break the walls of Jericho, ready go *
Sat where the old, cardboard city folk
Swap tales with heads like every other penny throw *

[Hook]
And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky like none shall pass
None shall pass
None shall pass

[Sufjan]
I call you
From the comet's cradle

I found you
Trembling by yourself

When the night falls
Lightly on your right-wing shoulder

Wonderful know-it-all
Slightly where the night gets colder

[Verse 3]
Okay woke to a grocery list, 
goes like this duty and death 
anyone object, come stand in the way
You could be my little Snake River Canyon today

And I ran with a chain of commands
And a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can
(Fine) sign of the vibe in the crowd
When I cut a belly open to find what climb out

That's quite a bit of gusto he muster up
To make a dark horse rush like enough's enough
It must've struck a nerve so they huff and puff
Till all the king's men fluster and clusterfuck

And it's a beautiful thing To my people who keep an impressive 
Wingspan even when the cubicle shrink
You got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
And march him through the machine

[Hook]
And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky like none shall pass

[Sufjan]
Oh, conscience,
Where will you carry me?

I found you
Star of terrifying effigies

When the night falls
I carry myself to the fortress

Of your glorious cost
Oh, I may seek your fortress

When the night falls
We see the star of wonder

Wonderful night falls
We see you, we see you there
