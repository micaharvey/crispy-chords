Up in smoke - Micah Arvey
Capo 5

D (Dsus 4, D, Dsus 2, D)    x4

Bm                             A                      D
Well I watched the town go up in smoke
And I watched everyone go broke
But it wasn’t bad, it wasn’t
Bm   A    G
Bad you see
Bm          A           D
It wasn’t bad for me

For now I can start a new
There are so many things to do
‘Cause I got a plan, I got a plan you see
Yeah I got a plan for me

Harmonica Interlude

Living life had become a chore
Work as a clerk was such a bore
Life was bad, life was bad you see
Life was bad for me

It seemed there was no way out
But rather than sitting and just poutin’
I set a fire, I set the fire you see
I set the fire for me.
