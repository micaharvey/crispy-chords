La-Di-Da

Am (7)          C
La-di-da-di-da
                                               Em    E 
You think you’ve come so far
The person that you are
Isn’t who you used… to…
Be so very kind
But then you changed your mind
And focused on the things
That you knew would bring… money

Chorus
Am   G   F                    C
But you lost all your friends
Am  G  F                       G
Was it worth it in the end?
Am       G    F        C
Would you do it again?
F
Noooooooo

La-di-da-di-da
You got yourself a car
Well it can take you far
But not far… e-
nough to see yourself
in sickness and in health
sick of all the things
that you found that money… brings

Chorus 

Solo (maybe over “into the water” chords)
