I regret every second i didn't spend getting it all
if I fail then I'll fall
if I get it I'll call
am I a friend or a foe
and I said it's my fault
and I said it's my fault

I gotta get in my mind and my mind is ready
cause my last tsecea bit it my tsecadeas always ready
Got a BOOM BOOM motha fucka 
RANG TANG need another
WOMB ROOM rep a peppa let that peppa pay

Remember me
Settle me my mind
memory memory can I get a second try
I don't count on it count on it
cause I get up every time
never bet on it bet on it
cause I aint got a second kind

Gotta get it right now cause I ain't got a second chance
As is you get it a passport then you get in france
but I'm america motha fucka so fuck me in the ass
and get it while you can cause I'm killin' the brand

I said a  
I wanna be a little bit better than I am
I wanna be a little bit better than I am

Tell me I can get it better tell me my name
I said I'm better than butter but man of metal is my middle name
then I get I get it and I forget it again
cause your my best friend so I don't mind it 
  
line em up dont time em out
holy god upon the grout
I caught you with B Boy on the town
I got the IPA you got the stout

chug that all and then you move on 
before you go on too long
you gon' throw up because you go
Bah Boo Bah Boo Bah Boo Bah

Bah Boo Bah Poo Baby
Baby bida-boo bah boo
Baby bubonic plague because you got a techtonic womb
I see you walkin' fast
I see you walkin' slow
I watch you walkin' past
those otha fuckas they don't know
