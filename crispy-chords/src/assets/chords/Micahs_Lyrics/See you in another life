If I could I would
fly higher than the moon and sun
I would surely burn in the end
my wings will melt as time will tell
when I have flown too high
where is my mind?
I swear I saw it swimming somewhere, but I
cannot stay here for long
I'm only passing by, I will
see you in another life  (whistle)

and i could if i would if i could not belive 
what youre saying to me is not real anymore

what is my mind made up of?
