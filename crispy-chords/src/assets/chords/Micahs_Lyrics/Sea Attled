Sea Attled

 
   A           E        Bm
I swear when it rains it clears my brain
    A         E          Bm            D
its all that remains that's keeping me sane
roaming around the underground
yeah my sails are down and I'm just flaoting around


   D          Bm
I'm far from shore 

      A       E
and a vicious storm

is knocking me down but I'm not afraid
cause it's been this way for many a day
thinking about how its worth the price
it rains at night its quite alright

I'm soaked to the bone
but they're mine to own

I swear when it rains man it clears my brain
its all that remains that's keeping me sane
roaming around the underground
yeah my sails are down and I'm just flaoting around

I'm far from shore 
and a vicious storm
