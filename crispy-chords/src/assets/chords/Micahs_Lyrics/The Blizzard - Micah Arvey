The Blizzard

     Am        G     F     G
They came very early in the morning,
and woke me with their surprise
They said my house was blocking their construction,
leave now or a problem would arise

I said, “I would have to think it over”
They thought I would surely go
I realized I was their only obstruction,
And courage I determined to show.

F   Am    G     C

I said, “I do not want to start a fight,
But I will, I will, if you take my rights,
I’ll not go, I’ll not go, but instead I’ll show,
If you bring a blizzard I’ll say let it snow!
Let it snow, I’ll not go, but instead I’ll show,
If you bring a blizzard I’ll say let it snow!”
