we decide to weather the weather of the 
Am
storm inside now we're together feelin'
F
So alive we'll fall forever, never

Hittin' the ground spare me save me somehow

we're the ones hopeless devoted to the
sound of drums dance like your heart is feelin'
overcome I was sweatin heavy breathin
in off the cloud breathin out silver crowns

I believe we were beside ourselves no
shirts no sleeves, out by the outskirts of the
human breed, but we were together no 
hatred was heard neither kept nor disturbed
