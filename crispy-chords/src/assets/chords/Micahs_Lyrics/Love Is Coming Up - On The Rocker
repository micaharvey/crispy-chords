Key - C#m / E
* = hit strings with fingernails


Verse 1
            C#m             *             C#m   
I dont know what you heard about me in the day,
*           C#m              Asus2          E
I can only tell you that it probably hasnt changed.
Asus2                   E
      I still act the same way,
Asus2                      E
      I fuck up, I make mistakes.

tell me everything was all for real,
cause now my visions blurring aqua teal,  
its an awkaward feel, until achilies feels his aweful heel,
and till the drip in your drink is a tear you spill.

We don't know, if we gonna make it,
end destination just blaze it,
Encore Encore go crazy, 
dont mind if my mind grows daisies.

CHORUS
It was drunken love, it was drunken love,
but now we're sobered up, and we're talking,
love is coming up, but I'm blocking,
love is coming up.

love is coming up, love is coming up
love is coming up, and we're talking,
love is coming up, and I'm walking,
love is coming up.

Verse 2
I dont know what that made you smile in the past,
I can only notice that it clearly didn't last.
you've got a beautiful smile, did you know that?
you're a beautiful wave, And I'm a fine raft.

Took mine off, we got the same task,
so please, take off your mask.
Please dont make me but I gotta ask
Where oh where along the line did you see me at?

CHORUS
It was drunken love, it was drunken love,
but now we're sobered up, and we're joking,
love is coming up, while we're sparking,
love is coming up.

love is coming up, love is coming up
love is coming up, and we're up all night,
love is coming up, and  I'm walking,
love is coming up.
 	
Verse 3
I dont know what you heard about me in the day,
I can only tell you that it probably hasnt changed.
      I play too many games,
      I fuck up and make mistakes.

But for real I believe it in my soul
I believe I'm on a roll
I believe in love and I believe in you
means I believe in us and I believe in lust too

Mm hmm
