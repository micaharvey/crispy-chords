AOK - Micah Arvey

* = breath

[Verse 1]
If I don’t go blow it
Maybe I could learn to show it *
  When I roll the dice Shakey
Always play twice  *

   I like it - I mic it
take a break and I could make it
split eyes peeled I spill upon ‘em
Still up in them trees forgot ‘em

 * scrubbin’ stackin’ bacon
achin’ till my knees quit shakin’
 * I could blame it surely
soul search for survivors holy

God I’m sayin’ way too much
I’m paying off for awful stuff
I'm layin’ down my mind’s thoughts
I bring an earring it’s been brought

[Chorus]
and I was in the 
background singin’ 
A O 
K O x4

*
[Verse 2]
Lovin life is all thats nice and
Finding all of why is callin'
Home *
I moan into to phone, * Mom *

Flipped a switch and ask her if
Offical niche is awful vicious
 *  Twitchin my mind is leakin'
Freakin cleanin' my mind's sqeakin'

Left of law is all thats left a
Trace        
 *  do believe that its the 
case by case in case    *

God I’m sayin’ way too much
I’m paying off for awful stuff
I'm layin’ down my mind’s thoughts
I bring an earring it’s been brought

CHORUS


















AOK - Micah Arvey


If I don’t go blow it
Maybe I could learn to show if
Baby, I could roll the dice Shakey
I could play twice and like a

wink I like it shake a mic and
take a break and I could make it
split eyes peeled I spill upon ‘em
Still up in them trees forgot ‘em

barel scrubbin’ stackin’ bacon
achin’ till my knees quit shakin’
For sure I could blame it surely
soul search for survivors holy

God I’m sayin’ way too much
I’m paying off for awful stuff
I'm layin’ down my mind’s thoughts
I bring an earring it’s been brought

CHORUS
and I was in the 
background singin’ 
A O 
K O x4

Lovin life is all thats nice and
Finding all of why is callin'
Home I moan into to phone cell
Mama came and give me hell I

Flipped a switch and ask her if
Offical niche is awful vicious
Twitchin like my mind is leakin'
Freakin cleanin' my mind's sqeakin'

Left of law is all thats left a
Trace behind of hedgehog breath dear
-ly departed we're bereft of
Awesome keys of pleasin' water

God I’m sayin’ way too much
I’m paying off for awful stuff
I'm layin’ down my mind’s thoughts
I bring an earring it’s been brought

CHORUS
