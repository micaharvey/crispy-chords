Chorus
Am     G              C
So you say you like a sad song
Thats ok by me
Cause it seems that a sad song
Is the only one I sing

This way we walk is winding
Night blue sky and blowin trees
Stepping lightly we're flying
Footprints covered up by leaves

Intro

Eyes meet eyesight still staring
Feeling fading point of view
Forgetting all the others out there
Feels like it is just us two

Walk the dirt path by the river
Wood cabin's up ahead
Though I doubt that we can make it
I still dream it in my head

Intro

Chorus (Hammer Time)

Intro

We walk this way together
Are you just here for you?
I'm not sure what we're after
before our fleeting time is through



picking favorites is hard
do what feels natural


Ignore all the other paths
blind to them
though they're right there
and I'd be a fool not to see you eyeing them
planning to leave

Really I just want the best
something inside me
says turn back before your lost
because you've got another
and my stones been tossed
