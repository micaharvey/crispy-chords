Capo 4

   G.....C

G                               C
I lived in a place called Olfuskee
C                                    G
And I had a little girl in a holler tree
G                                   C
I said, little girl, it's plain to see
C                                      G
There ain't nobody that can sing like me
D                                C
Ain't nobody that can sing like me

G                            C
She said its hard for me to see
C                           G
how one little boy got so ugly
G                               C
Yes, my little girly that might be
C                                         G
but there ain't nobody that can sing like me
D                               C
Ain't nobody that can sing like me

  C                             G
  Way over yonder in the minor key
  Am                            G
  Way over yonder in the minor key
  D                                     C
  There ain't nobody that can sing like me

We walked on down by the buckeye creek
to see the frog eat the goggle eyed bee
to hear that west wind whistle to the east
there ain't nobody that can sing like me

Oh my little girly will you let me see
way over yonder where the wind blows free
Nobody can see in our holler tree
and there ain't nobody that can sing like me

  Way over yonder in the minor key
  Way over yonder in the minor key
  There ain't nobody that can sing like me

Her mama cut a switch from a cherry tree
and laid it on the she and me
It stung much worse than the hive of bees
but there ain't nobody that can sing like me

Now I have walked a long long ways
but I still look back to my tanglewood days
I've led lots of girls since then to stray
saying, ain't nobody that can sing like me
  
  Way over yonder in the minor key
  Way over yonder in the minor key
  There ain't nobody that can sing like me
