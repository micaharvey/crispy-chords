Crazy - Gnarls Barkley

Capo 3


Am                                                      C
I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
                                             F
There was something so pleasant about that phase.

Even your emotions had an echo
               Esus   E
In so much space
Am
And when you're out there, without care,
                     C
Yeah, I was out of touch
                                       F
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
                       Esus  E
I just knew too much


                  Am
Does that make me crazy?
                  C
Does that make me crazy??
                  F
Does that make me crazy???
                  Esus     E
Possibly.


A                                                F
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
            C                    Esus   E
But think twice, that's my only advice
Am                                                                     C
Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are,
                      F
Ha ha ha bless your soul
                             Esus       E
You really think you're in control


(the verse after this chorus uses the same chord pattern as the verse above, starting 
A MAJOR)


Well, I think you're crazy!
I think you're crazy!
I think you're crazy,
Just like me.

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably
