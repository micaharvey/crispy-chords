Capo 5

Intro
G   D 
Verse 1
 G                  D
I am thinking its a sign 
                         C9
that the freckles in our eyes are mirror images
   G/B                  D
and when we kiss they're perfectly aligned 
    G               D
and I, have to specu-late 
                     C9
that god himself did make us into corresponding 
G/B               D
shapes like puzzle pieces from the clay 
    G                        D
and true, it may seem like a stretch 
                                  C9
but it's thoughts like this that catch my troubled head 
                  G/B                 D
when you're a-way, when I am missing you to death 
G                             D
when you are out there on the road 
                     C9
for several weeks of shows 
                          G/B
and when you scan the radio
            D
I hope this song will guide you home 


Chorus 
G                               D
they will see us waving from such great heights 
     C9               G/B   D
come down now, they'll say  
    G                       D
but everything looks perfect from far away 
     C9
     
come down now 
    G/B        D
but we'll stay  

verse 2
G                   D
I tried my best to leave
                   C9
this all on your machine 

but the persistent beat, it
G/B           D
sounded thin u-pon listening 
 G                         D
and that frankly, will not fly
                   C9
you will hear the shrillest highs
                         G/B
and lowest lows with the win-dows down 
      D
when this is guiding you'ome 


Chours
G                                 D
they will see us waving from such great heights
     C9                 G/B    D
come down now, they'll  say 
    G                            D
but everything looks perfect from far away 
     C9
come down now 
   G/B       D
but we'll stay 

G                              D
they will see us waving from such great heights 
     C9              G/B    D
come down now, they'll say  
   G                             D
but everything looks perfect from far away 
    C9
come down now 
   G/B         D
but we'll stay 

End on G
